# 📚 Learning Projects

Focused, single-concept exercises that build a precise understanding of Python's core mechanics. Each sub-folder isolates one idea — closures, decorators, dynamic attributes, or graph representations — and demonstrates it through minimal, readable code.

These exercises underpin everything in the Professional Projects folder: a solid grasp of scope, object introspection, and higher-order functions makes larger OOP systems much easier to reason about.

## 📁 Subfolders

| Folder | Concept | Key Tool |
|---|---|---|
| [`classes and objects/`](./classes%20and%20objects/) | Dynamic attribute introspection | `setattr`, `getattr`, `hasattr`, `delattr` |
| [`decorator/`](./decorator/) | Function decorators & closures | Higher-order functions, `wrapper()` |
| [`graphs/`](./graphs/) | Graph data structure representations | Adjacency matrix, adjacency list |
| [`inner function/`](./inner%20function/) | Closures and nested function scope | `nonlocal`, LEGB rules |

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Python's object model and runtime attribute management
- Higher-order functions and the decorator pattern
- Lexical scoping, closures, and the `nonlocal` keyword
